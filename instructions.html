                                <p>First that “greets” you in the Personal Cabinet is the message with the actual domain
                                    for your partner’s link:</p>
                                <p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full"
                                        src="./img/banner-main-page-2.webp" alt="" width="844" height="402"></p>
                                <p>You can choose “Do not show anymore” in it, as with any blockage the actual domain
                                    address will come to your email and your Telegram-channel. You will have to follow
                                    the domain renewal (they are normally refreshed once a day), as they are being
                                    blocked by Roskomnadzor on the territory of the Russian Federation, and the old
                                    domains stop working from time to time. So to maintain the constant access to the
                                    site for your users you will have to change the domain in your links yourself or go
                                    to the personal cabinet and copy the whole link. There is no need to create the new
                                    link each time as it will be created automatically.</p>
                                <p>At the right side of the page there will be a “Question” button which can be used to
                                    send the message to Support, then the “Refresh statistics” button, which makes a
                                    forced data refresh. You will have to switch the language at the PP site and your
                                    unique Aff ID nearby, which can be used as a substitute for login or email when
                                    addressing our managers or support. Pressing it will open an additional menu which
                                    can be used either to exit your account or to switch to your profile where you will
                                    see all data stated. You can edit some of them, change the password, setup the
                                    two-factor verification or switch off the mailing concerning the domain change.</p>

                                <p>“SubID” is used to divide the links and to track their individual effectiveness. For
                                    example, placing several links at one site you will be able to specify the different
                                    SubID and then follow them in the <b>Promo materials report</b> to see which is

                                <p>One more instrument to attract the players is the promocode. Promocode can be used in
                                    combination with the partner link as well as separately – anyway the player will be
                                    fixed with this promocode. Code should be entered at BC registration after which it
                                    will increase the maximum first deposit bonus by 30%. For example the maximum amount
                                    of bonus that player might get is $50 and with promocode it will be $65, however,
                                    the bonus is equal to the deposit amount.</p>

                                    the payments will be provided automatically. The payments are done once a week (each

                                    the 1001st player. The re-calculation is done for the whole month, thus starting
                                    with 15% each month as soon as you reach the needed amount of deposits there will be
                                    a re-calculation for the existing percentage. AS soon as payments are done each
                                    week, and you reached a re-calculation cap (for example) at 2nd or 3rd week – the
                                    difference will be calculated at the end of the month and added to the main sum.</p>
